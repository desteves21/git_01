## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
A boat beneath a sunny sky,
Lingering onward dreamily
In an evening of July 
Children three that nestle near,
Eager eye and willing ear

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
Before man came to blow it right
     The wind once blew itself untaught,
And did its loudest day and night
     In any rough place where it caught.
 Man came to tell it what was wrong
## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
"The sun was shining on the sea,  
      Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
      The billows smooth and bright —  
And this was odd, because it was  
      The middle of the night.  

The moon was shining sulkily,  
      Because she thought the   
Had got no business to be there  
      After the day was done —  
"It's very rude of him," she said,  
      "To come and spoil the fun."  

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
In the halls of history, they stride, the few, the proud,  
Bound by honor, in the heart of battle, they're endowed.  
From shore to shore, their valor knows no bounds,  
In the crucible of conflict, where courage resounds.  

With eagle-eyed precision, they answer the call,  
Forged in the crucible, they never falter, never fall.  
Through storm and strife, they march as one,  
Their spirit unyielding, beneath the blazing sun.  

In the silent depths where the oceans roar,  
They guard the nation's gate, forevermore.  
With every step, they write a legacy bold,  
In the sands of time, their stories are told.  

They are the guardians of freedom's flame,  
In the face of danger, they etch their name.  
With each scar borne, they carry the load  
Their unwavering resolve, an unbreakable code.  

Through trials and triumphs, they stand tall,  
United as one, they heed the call.   
For in the heart of the Marine Corps' creed,  
Lies the strength of warriors, in word and   

So let their banner wave, in glory unfurled,  
For they are the guardians of the free world.  
In the annals of valor, they find their place  
The Marine Corps, a symbol of courage and
