In the halls of history, they stride, the few, the proud,  
Bound by honor, in the heart of battle, they're endowed.  
From shore to shore, their valor knows no bounds,  
In the crucible of conflict, where courage resounds.  

With eagle-eyed precision, they answer the call,  
Forged in the crucible, they never falter, never fall.  
Through storm and strife, they march as one,  
Their spirit unyielding, beneath the blazing sun.  

In the silent depths where the oceans roar,  
They guard the nation's gate, forevermore.  
With every step, they write a legacy bold,  
In the sands of time, their stories are told.  

They are the guardians of freedom's flame,  
In the face of danger, they etch their name.  
With each scar borne, they carry the load  
Their unwavering resolve, an unbreakable code.  

Through trials and triumphs, they stand tall,  
United as one, they heed the call.   
For in the heart of the Marine Corps' creed,  
Lies the strength of warriors, in word and   

So let their banner wave, in glory unfurled,  
For they are the guardians of the free world.  
In the annals of valor, they find their place  
The Marine Corps, a symbol of courage and
