In the hush of twilightâ€™s gleam,  
The moon ascends with silver beam.  
Stars awaken, softly they sing,  
A lullaby on gentle wing.  

The trees, they sway in whispered grace,  
Casting shadows, an intricate lace.  
The night, a canvas, vast and deep,  
Where secrets of the universe sleep.  

Oceans murmur to the shore,  
A rhythm ancient, timeless lore.  
The wind, a wanderer, free and wild,  
Carries tales both fierce and mild.  

Beneath this sky, so vast, so wide,
Dreams take flight, no bounds, no tide.  
In the quiet, hearts find their peace,  
As the world spins on in silent ease.  

The stars, they wink, a cosmic dance,  
Inviting all to take a chance.  
In this moment, still and bright,  
We find the beauty in the night.
